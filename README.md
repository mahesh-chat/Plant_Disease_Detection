# Plant_Disease_Detection

Plant disease detection is implemented using siamese neural network . There is limited data is present for training also the no of classes of diseases is also very large.This problem suits the siamese neural network which is not perfectly solved by standard Convulational neural networks.


 
Identification of the plant diseases is the key to preventing the losses in the yield and quantity of the agricultural product. The studies of the plant diseases mean the studies of visually observable patterns seen on the plant. Health monitoring and disease detection on plant is very critical for sustainable agriculture. It is very difficult to monitor the plant diseases manually. It requires tremendous amount of work, expertize in the plant diseases, and also require the excessive processing time. Hence, image processing is used for the detection of plant diseases. Disease detection involves the steps like image acquisition, image pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction and classification.
Disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture as farmers have often to decide whether the crop they are harvesting is good enough. It is of utmost importance to take this seriously as it can lead to serious problems in plants due to which product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. Plant diseases cause a periodic outbreak of diseases leading to large-scale death which severely affects the economy. Here computer vision algorithms can be used to provide image-based automatic inspection. Manual identification is labor intensive, less accurate and can be done only in small areas at a time. By this method, the plant diseases can be identified at the initial stage itself and the pest and infection control tools can be used to solve pest problems while minimizing risks to people and the environment.
